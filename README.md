# Diffusion-TF

This repository provides a collection of TensorFlow 2 implementations/ ports for diffusion-based research. 

The projects are self-contained and can be found [here](https://github.com/Nikolai10/Diffusion-TF/blob/master/projects/). 
All models are instances of [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model), hence multi-gpu training can be enabled with minor adjustments thanks to [tf.distribute.Strategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#use_tfdistributestrategy_with_custom_training_loops).

Under active development.
